# Unity Recorder V1.0 User Manual

![Unity Recorder](Images/RecorderSplash.png)


Use the Unity Recorder to capture and save in-game data during [Play Mode](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GameView.html). For example, use the Unity Recorder to capture and save gameplay as an MP4 file.

A recorder specifies details for creating a recording, including a data source, resolution, and output format. The Unity Recorder package includes the following recorders:

* __Animation Recorder__: generates an animation clip in ANIM format.

* __Movie Recorder__: generates a video in MP4 or WebM format.

* __Image Recorder__: generates a sequence of image files in JPEG, PNG, or OpenEXR format.

* __GIF Recorder__: generates an animated GIF file.

The Unity Recorder also supports [Timeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/TimelineSection.html). Use Recorder tracks and clips to trigger recording sessions from Timeline instances.

## Limitations

The Unity Recorder has the following limitations:

* The Recorder window and Recorder properties are not available in standalone Unity Players.

* To use Unity Recorder with Scriptable Render Pipeline (SRP) or High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP), use only the __Game View__, __360 View__, or __Render Texture__ choices in the __Capture__ drop-down menu.

* The __Animation Recorder__ only records a [GameObject](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-GameObject.html) in the current Scene. It does not record a GameObject in other scenes.

* The __Movie Recorder__ does not support variable frame rates.

* The Unity Recorder does not capture frames at a consistent rate from systems that use a real-time clock, like the [Video Player](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/VideoPlayer.html). Data captured from these systems might appear speeded up or slowed down.

# Upgrading Unity Recorder

Besides new features, Unity Recorder 1.0 has a few notable changes:

* Use the __Window > General > Recorder__ menu to access Unity Recorder features. Features for older versions of Unity Recorder were accessible from the __Window > Recorder__ menu.

* Unity Recorder includes new, updated recorders. These recorders take advantage of Unity Editor features and are more stable than previous versions. However, if you must use the legacy recorders, toggle __Window > General > Recorder > Options > Show Legacy Recorders__.

To upgrade to Unity Recorder 1.0 from an earlier version:

1. In Unity Editor, open your Unity Project.

2. Save the current Scene.

3. In the [Project](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/ProjectView.html) window, expand the *Unity Technologies* folder and select the *Recorder* folder.

4. In the main menu, choose __Edit > Delete__.

5. Quit Unity then re-open your project.

6. Use the [Unity Asset Store](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AssetStore.html) to search for and install Unity Recorder 1.0.

# Setting up Recorders

Use the recorder list in the __Recorder__ window to add, rename, edit, duplicate, and delete recorders. You can also save and delete your recorder list as an asset to reuse in your project and in other projects.

**Tip:** You can save a recorder as a [Preset](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Presets.html). You can also specify a preset for recorder settings as a default when creating new recorders.

Re-opening the __Recorder__ window restores the values of the last recording session.

To add a recorder:

1. Open the Recorder from the Unity menu (__Window > General > Recorder__).

2. In the recorder list, click __+ Add New Recorders__ to choose from a drop-down menu.

3. Adjust the settings for the new recorder.

4. Optionally rename the new recorder by single-clicking its name.

To delete or duplicate a recorder:

1. Open the Recorder from the Unity menu (__Windows > General > Recorder__).

2. In the recorder list, right-click the recorder and choose __Delete__ or __Duplicate__.

__Tip:__ You can also delete and duplicate recorders with the Delete and Ctrl+D/Cmd+D keys, respectively.

To save, load, or clear settings for all recorders:

1. Open the Recorder window from the Unity menu (__Windows > General > Recorder__).

2. In the recorder list, click the drop-down menu.

3. Do one of the following:

    * To save your recorder list as an asset, choose __Save Recorder List__.

    * To load a recorder list, choose __Load Recorder List__, then the list to load.

    * To delete all recorders in your list, choose __Clear Recorder List__.

# Recording in Play Mode

When recording in Play Mode, use the __Record Mode__ property to specify when to start and stop the recording. You can manually start and stop recording, specify a single frame, a range of frames, or a range of time. You can set up more than one recorder to record the same Scene.

**Note:** During recording, you cannot modify the properties in the Recorder window.

To record a scene in Play Mode:

1. Set up your scene to prepare it for recording.

2. Open the Recorder from the Unity menu (__Window > General > Recorder__).

3. In the recorder list, select then set up the recorder to use.

4. Set the __Record Mode__ and __Frame Rate__ properties.

5. Repeat steps 3-4 to use other recorders for the same Scene.

6. Click __Start Recording__ or press F10. Unity Recorder activates Play Mode if it is not already active. The progress bar displays the number of frames or images recorded.

7. When you are ready to stop recording, click __Stop Recording__ or press F10. You only need to stop recording when using the Manual record mode.  Your game continues in Play Mode.

**Tip:** Closing the Recorder window, or exiting Play Mode and returning to Edit Mode, also stops the recording.

# Recording from a Timeline track

You can start and stop recordings from the [Timeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/TimelineSection.html). A __Recorder Track__ in Timeline contains one or more __Recorder Clips__. Each clip specifies a recording to start and stop while Timeline plays the __Recorder Track__.

![Adding a Recorder Track in Timline.](Images/TimelineRecorderTrack.png)

A __Recorder Clip__ has the same properties as a recorder in the Recorder window except for the following differences:

* Recording mode can only be set to Constant. Timeline can only play using a constant frame rate.

* The frame rate of the recording inherits from the Timelineâ€™s __Frame Rate__ setting.

* The __Clip Timing__ section replaces the __Bounds/Limits__ section. Instead, use the __Start__, __End__, and __Duration__ properties to set when recording occurs.

* Use the __Recorder Category__ property to select which recorder the Timeline clip uses.

* The __Recorder Clip__ properties are stored in the Timeline Track and do not affect the properties in the Recorder window.

To set up a recording session in a Timeline instance:

1. Select the GameObject in your Scene that is associated with the Timeline Asset.

2. In the Timeline window, click __Add__ and select __Recorder Track__.

3. Right-click the __Recorder Track__ and select __Add Recorder Clip__.

4. Select the __Recorder Clip__ to view and edit its recording properties in the __Inspector__ window.

# Debugging Recorders

You can view the GameObject that Unity Recorder creates in your Scene. This GameObject is named __Unity-RecorderSessions__. It contains the components and child GameObjects that the Unity Recorder creates to maintain bindings between the Recorder and the GameObjects in your Scene. Also, while recording, the __Unity-RecorderSessions__ GameObject contains components that store the progress of current recording session. It is by default hidden from the [Hierarchy](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Hierarchy.html) window.

To toggle the visibility of the __Unity-RecorderSessions__ GameObject, choose __Window > General > Recorder > Options > Show Recorder GameObject__.

# Recorder Window

Manage recorders and control recording in the Recorder window. The Recorder window has these sections:

* Recording controls: Start and stop recordings, and specify their duration and frame rate.

* Recorder list: the recorders you have added or loaded.

* Recorder properties: Specify the recording properties, such as the output format and encoding, file name and location.

## Recording controls

Use the recording controls to start and stop a recording. Specify when to start and stop a recording with the __Record Mode__ properties. Use the __Frame Rate__ properties to specify how to constrain the frame rate during recording. The frame rate affects the size and number of the captured output files.


|Property:|Function:|
|:---|:---|
| __Start Recording__ <br/> __Stop Recording__ |Starts and stops recording. Clicking __Start Recording__ also activates Play Mode if it is not already active.|
| __Record Mode__ |Specifies the frames or time duration to record.|
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _Manual_ |Start and stop recording when you manually click __Start Recording__ and __Stop Recording__, respectively.|
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _Single Frame_ |Record a single frame. Use the __Frame Number__ property to specify this frame.|
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _Frame Interval_ |Record a consecutive set of frames during Play Mode. Use the __First Frame__ and __Last Frame__ properties to specify when to start and stop.|
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _Time Interval_ |Record a specific duration during Play Mode. Use the __Start__ and __End__ properties to specify when to start and stop.|
| __Frame Number__ |Specifies the number of the frame to capture when using the __Single Frame__ mode.|
| __First Frame__ <br/> __Last Frame__ |Specifies the range of frames to capture when in __Frame Interval__ mode.|
| __Start__ <br/> __End__ |Specifies the time, in seconds, to begin and finish recording.|
| __Playback__ |Specifies how to control the frame rate during recording.|
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _Constant_ |Limit the recorder to a specific frame rate. Use the __Target__ property to specify this rate.|
|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; _Variable_ |Use the frame rate of the game. Specify the upper limit of the rate of the game during recording with the __Max Frame Rate__ property. **Note:** The __Movie Recorder__ does not support a variable frame rate.|
| __Target__ |The frame rate to capture when using the __Constant__ setting in __Playback__. The Unity Recorder captures at this rate regardless of whether the game is played at a higher or lower frame rate. For example, if __Target__ is set to a custom value of 30 fps but the game plays at 60 fps, the recording is captured at 30 fps.|
| __Max Frame Rate__ |Limit the rate of updates in Play Mode. This property is available when __Playback__ is __Variable__. To prevent your game from exceeding this frame rate, the Unity Recorder inserts delays during game play. Use this property to reduce the size of the output.|
| __Cap Frame Rate__ |Check this property when the frame rate of your game is faster than the __Target__ frame rate. This property is available when __Playback__ is __Constant__.|


## Recorder properties

These properties specify the file name and location to store the output from a recorder. These properties are available for all recorders.
